This dir contains special purpose programs used by the
workflow scripts.

Also some reference versions of HMI observables code,
to be kept here until the "official" versions are
checked in and can be built in ~jsoc.

The binaries are not checked in, so copy from ~phil/jsoc/proj/workflow/bin for now.
